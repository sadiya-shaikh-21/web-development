 	<h3>Python Lists</h3><br>
 	Difficulty Level : Easy
 &nbsp; Last Updated : 29 Jun, 2020<br><br>

 	<p>
 		<b>Lists</b> are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language">Python</a>. A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
 	</p>

 	<p>
 		List in Python are ordered and have a definite count. The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index. Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.
 	</p>

 	<b>Note-</b> Lists are a useful tool for preserving a sequence of data and further iterating over it.<br><br>

 	<div>
 		# Python program to demonstrate  <br>
		# Creation of List<br>  
		  
		# Creating a List <br>
		List = [] <br>
		print("Blank List: ")<br> 
		print(List) <br><br>
		  
		# Creating a List of numbers <br>
		List = [10, 20, 14] <br>
		print("\nList of numbers: ") <br>
		print(List)<br><br> 
		  
		# Creating a List of strings and accessing<br> 
		# using index <br>
		List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"] <br>
		print("\nList Items: ") <br>
		print(List[0])<br>  
		print(List[2]) <br>
		  
		# Creating a Multi-Dimensional List <br>
		# (By Nesting a list inside a List) <br>
		List = [['Geeks', 'For'] , ['Geeks']]<br> 
		print("\nMulti-Dimensional List: ") <br>
		print(List) <br>
 	</div>
 	<br><br>
 	<b>Output:</b>
 	<div style="background: white;color: black">
		Blank List: <br>
		[]<br><br>

		List of numbers:<br> 
		[10, 20, 14]<br><br>

		List Items<br>
		Geeks<br>
		Geeks<br><br>

		Multi-Dimensional List: <br>
		[['Geeks', 'For'], ['Geeks']]<br>
